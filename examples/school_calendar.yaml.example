# SCHOOL CALENDAR CONFIGURATION (school_calendar.yaml.example)
# ==============================================
#
# What this file does
# - Drives the dashboard's school-day logic (school/no-school), breaks, and late-start behavior.
# - Feeds the bus countdown logic via the `bus_schedule` section.
#
# Install
# 1) Copy/rename this file to: /config/<your_dashboard_folder>/school_calendar.yaml
#    - Remove the .example extension
# 2) Update dates to match your school district calendar.
# 3) Restart Home Assistant (Settings → System → Restart) or reload the package if your setup supports it.
#
# Date rules
# - All dates MUST be quoted strings in YYYY-MM-DD format.
# - Ranges (`breaks`) are inclusive of BOTH start and end.
# - `no_school_days` is for single days only.
#
# Tips
# - Put comments on the same line as the date for quick scanning.
# - If something looks wrong on the dashboard, verify:
#   - `binary_sensor.school_day`
#   - `binary_sensor.bus_timer_active`
#   - any related sensors in Developer Tools → States
