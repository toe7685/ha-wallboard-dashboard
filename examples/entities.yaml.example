# ENTITY MAPPING (EXAMPLE)
# ==============================================
#
# Purpose
# - Central place to map YOUR entity IDs to the dashboard.
# - This file is safe to edit and will not be overwritten by Home Assistant.
#
# Quick start
# 1) Copy this file to `entities.yaml` (remove the `.example` suffix)
# 2) Replace placeholder values with your real entity IDs
# 3) Find entity IDs in Home Assistant:
#    Settings → Developer Tools → States
# 4) To disable any optional feature, set its value to: none
#
# Notes
# - Use the entity_id exactly as shown in Developer Tools (case-sensitive).
# - Keep quotes only for display labels or values with special characters.
