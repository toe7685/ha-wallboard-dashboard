# ==============================================================================
# SCHOOL LUNCH MENUS (Example)
# ==============================================================================
# Purpose
# - Provides a simple 3-week rotating (Mon–Fri) lunch menu for two schools.
# - Intended to be read by Home Assistant template logic in your wallboard package.
#
# Quick start
# 1) Copy/rename this file to `school_menus.yaml` (remove `.example`).
# 2) Replace the placeholder menu items with your real menus.
# 3) Set `menu_cycle_start` to the first date your district starts a Week 0/1/2 cycle.
# 4) Set `starting_cycle_index` to match which week begins on that date (0, 1, or 2).
# 5) Restart Home Assistant (or reload your package if your setup supports it).
#
# Notes / assumptions
# - The cycle is 3 weeks long (indexes 0, 1, 2).
# - Each week entry must include keys: monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday.
# - Each day’s value is a list of one or more options (strings).
# - Weekends are not represented here.
#
# Validation checklist (common gotchas)
# - Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
# - Keep quotes around menu items if they contain special characters like ':' or '#'.
# - Ensure each school has exactly 3 week blocks under `*_menus`.
